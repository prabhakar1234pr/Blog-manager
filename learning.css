Styling Modern Blog Interfaces with CSS

Once we have a well-structured blog component, we can use CSS to transform it into a
visually appealing, modern interface. Currently, our blog looks like a simple list of
text posts without proper styling.

In this task, we'll apply CSS styles to create a modern blog UI with these key design elements:

1. Blog Post Cards
   - Clean, card-based design for each blog post
   - Subtle shadows and rounded corners for depth
   - Clear separation between content and metadata

2. Visual Hierarchy
   - Proper spacing and layout for improved readability
   - Distinct styling for post titles, content, and metadata
   - Consistent color scheme and typography

3. Modern Form Design
   - Styling the blog creation form for better usability
   - Improving input fields and button appearances
   - Creating a cohesive design language

4. Responsive Design
   - Ensuring the blog interface works well on different screen sizes
   - Adjusting layout and sizing for mobile devices

We'll implement these styles incrementally, focusing on one section at a time to
understand how each change affects the overall appearance of the blog interface.
