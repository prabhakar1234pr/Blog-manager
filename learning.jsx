/*
Structuring React Components for Blog Interfaces

A well-structured blog interface is critical for both functionality and styling. Currently, our
blog manager component displays blog posts as a simple list without proper structure or organization.

In this task, we'll improve the HTML/JSX structure to prepare it for styling by focusing on:

1. Blog Post Organization
   - Separating post content from metadata
   - Adding appropriate class names for styling
   - Creating a clear visual structure for blog post entries

2. Form Structure
   - Organizing input controls logically
   - Adding proper container elements
   - Improving form layout and accessibility

3. CSS Class Naming
   - Using descriptive class names that follow a consistent pattern
   - Adding specific classes for different UI elements
   - Creating a class hierarchy that maps to the visual hierarchy

These structural improvements will make our component:
- Easier to style with CSS
- More accessible for all users
- More maintainable in the long term
- More closely aligned with modern blog UI conventions

We'll implement these changes one step at a time, starting with the basic blog structure,
then improving the form elements, and finally adding keyboard support.
